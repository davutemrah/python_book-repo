## Multiples of 3 - 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```{python}
a = [x for x in range(1, 10) if (x%3==0 or x%5==0)]
sum(a)==23
```


```{python}
b = [x for x in range(1, 1000) if (x%3==0 or x%5==0)]
print(sum(b))
```


## Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```{python}
fib_list = [1, 2]

while True:
  
  x = fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2]
  
  if x > 4000000:
    break
  
  fib_list.append(x)
  
even_sum = [x for x in fib_list if x%2==0]

sum(even_sum)
```

## Largest prime factor

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

```{python}
# primes = [1, 2]
# 
# while True:
#   
#   for x in range(2, 10):
#     
#     x%i==0
```



## Greatest Common Diviser

```{python}
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Example usage:
print(gcd(55, 60))  # Output: 12
```
