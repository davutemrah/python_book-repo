## apply method

Using `apply` in **NumPy** and **Pandas** is a common practice to perform element-wise operations or to apply custom functions across data structures. 

Here are some examples:



### Using `apply` in Pandas:

Pandas' `apply` function is very powerful for applying custom functions along either axis (rows or columns) of a DataFrame or across a Series.



#### Applying a Function to a DataFrame Column

Imagine you have a DataFrame `df` with a column `salary`, and you want to calculate a 10% increase for all salaries.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {'employee': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'salary': [50000, 60000, 70000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Apply a function to increase salary by 10%
df['new_salary'] = df['salary'].apply(lambda x: x * 1.10)
print(df)
```




#### Applying a Function Across Rows

You have a DataFrame with columns `x` and `y`, and you want to create a new column `z` which is the sum of `x` and `y`.

```python
# Sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]})

# Apply a function row-wise
df['z'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['x'] + row['y'], axis=1)
print(df)
```




#### Using `apply` with a Custom Function

You can also use `apply` to apply a custom function defined outside the `apply` call.

```python
# Custom function to categorize salary
def categorize_salary(salary):
    if salary > 60000:
        return 'High'
    else:
        return 'Low'

# Apply the custom function to the 'salary' column
df['salary_category'] = df['salary'].apply(categorize_salary)
print(df)
```





### Using `apply` in NumPy:

NumPy's `apply_along_axis` function is used to apply a function along a particular axis of a NumPy array.

#### Applying a Function to Each Row of a 2D NumPy Array

Suppose you have a 2D array and want to calculate the sum of each row.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample 2D array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Function to calculate sum of an array
def row_sum(row):
    return np.sum(row)

# Apply the function along the axis 1 (rows)
result = np.apply_along_axis(row_sum, axis=1, arr=arr)
print(result)  # Output: [ 6 15 24]
```



#### Applying a Function to Each Column of a 2D NumPy Array

Similar to the previous example, but applied along the columns.

```python
# Function to calculate the mean of an array
def column_mean(column):
    return np.mean(column)

# Apply the function along the axis 0 (columns)
result = np.apply_along_axis(column_mean, axis=0, arr=arr)
print(result)  # Output: [4. 5. 6.]
```

### Key Points to Mention in an Interview:

- **Pandas' `apply` function** is very versatile and is generally used to apply custom functions row-wise or column-wise in a DataFrame or to a Series.

- **NumPy's `apply_along_axis`** is more specific and used for applying a function along a specific axis (rows or columns) of an array.

- These functions are particularly useful when built-in functions are not sufficient or when custom operations are needed.

- While `apply` can be convenient, it's worth mentioning that it can be slower than vectorized operations in Pandas and NumPy, so it should be used judiciously.

These examples should provide you with a solid foundation to demonstrate your understanding of `apply` in NumPy and Pandas during a data science interview.
