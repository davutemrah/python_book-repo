## Functions

In Python, `return` and `print` are used for different purposes in functions:

1. **`return`**:
   - `return` is used to send a value back to the caller of the function.
   - When a function is called, it can perform some operations and then use `return` to send a result back to where the function was called.
   - The value returned by `return` can be stored in a variable, used in expressions, or passed to other functions.
   - Once `return` is executed, the function terminates immediately.

   Example:
   ```python
   def get_greeting():
       return "Hello, World!"

   greeting = get_greeting()
   print(greeting)  # This will print: Hello, World!
   ```

2. **`print`**:
   - `print` is used to output text to the console.
   - It does not send any value back to the caller; it simply outputs the given string or other data types to the standard output (usually the console).
   - The function continues executing after `print` unless it encounters a `return` or another statement that terminates the function.

   Example:
   ```python
   def display_greeting():
       print("Hello, World!")

   display_greeting()  # This will print: Hello, World!
   ```

### Summary

- Use `return` to send a value from the function to its caller.
- Use `print` to display a value to the console.

Here is a combined example to illustrate both:

```python
def get_and_display_greeting():
    greeting = "Hello, World!"
    print(greeting)  # This will print: Hello, World!
    return greeting

returned_value = get_and_display_greeting()
print(f"The returned value is: {returned_value}")  # This will print: The returned value is: Hello, World!
```

In this example, `print` outputs the greeting to the console, and `return` sends the greeting back to where the function was called, which is then stored in `returned_value` and printed again.



**Note:**Functions that do not have an explicit return expression will implicitly return the None object. The details of None will be covered in a later exercise. For the purposes of this exercise and explanation, None is a placeholder that represents nothing, or null:
